The questionnaire app that matches you to a film/tv character you should date.


ABOUT

This app is aimed towards very sad people that waste their life thinking about possible relationships they could have 
with various film and television characters when they could be busy forming bonds with other human beings. Hence the term 
''sad person''. If you are one of these sad people, we would like to thank you for being our guinea pigs. 

HOW THE APP WORKS

You will be taken through a list of psychologically intensive questions that tunnel deep within the inner caves 
of your soul, assessing who you are as a person.

Beware! Our conclusions may not be pretty.

For every question that you think best describes you or your opinions, simply tick the box and touch ''next question'' 
when done. Once all questions are complete, you will be matched with a film/tv character that we think best suits you. 
After you are given your match you can then click upon the character icon and see how your date may unfold via the 
subordinate form of literature know as comic strips.
