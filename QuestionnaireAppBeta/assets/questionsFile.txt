How do you feel about 'art' that has dead creatures within its centerpiece e.g. Something by Damien Hirst?=
3=
If that artist who petrified his own turd inside a box can call that 'art', why not classify a work that uses a dead creature as art.;No. All art should be like that painting where the dogs play poker.;Frankly my dear I don't give a damn about art classification.=

Should Army Generals ever become politicians?=
3=
Sure, the corridors of power are almost played out like a war scenario itself. A metaphysical war that is. So it helps to have someone who is strategically minded to sift through the corrosive political waffle.;

What is the best way to stop crime?=
3=
Invest money into socially disadvantaged areas and create jobs. Thus local people will be less likely to turn to crime to make a living.;
Invest money into state of the art crime fighting equipment. Make an elaborate armoured costume. Negotiate with pesky criminals via your fists.;
Watching the Brady Bunch solves all life's problems.=

With films/tv shows that depict a long bygone era, is historical accuracy important?=
3=
Its a larger crime for a film/tv show to be boring, so accuracy be damned.;

Should men be 'Men' and women be 'Women'?=
3=
Of course, things get creepy when we have men with female attributes and vice versa. Having strong gender identities keeps life simple. ; Masculinity, femininity, what do they really mean? They're artificial social constructs. Let people be what they want. ; Its ok that a man cries or that a woman acts like a 'tomboy', but only in small doses.=
